## Project Process

### 1. Data Collection üóÉÔ∏è
- Collected a diverse dataset of speech samples containing various emotions.

### 2. Data Preparation üßπ
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data for analysis, ensuring quality and consistency.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç
- Conducted thorough analysis to uncover key patterns and distributions in the dataset.

### 4. Feature Extraction üéöÔ∏è
- Extracted Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) from the audio data to serve as input features for the model.

### 5. Model Development ü§ñ
- Built and trained a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify emotions.

### 6. Results Visualization üìâ
- Visualized the model‚Äôs performance and accuracy through various plots to assess effectiveness.

## Results
The model achieved a notable accuracy in classifying emotions from speech data. Detailed results, including accuracy metrics and visualizations, can be found in the `results` folder.
