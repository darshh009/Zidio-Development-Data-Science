# Digit Recognition Project

## Overview
This project implements a digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits. The system aims to accurately classify these digits with high precision.

## Features
- Recognizes handwritten digits (0-9).
- High accuracy in classification.
- User-friendly interface for inputting images.
- Real-time prediction capability.

## Technologies Used
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations and array manipulations.
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating plots and visual representations.
- **Keras**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **TensorFlow**: For advanced mathematical functions.

## Project Process

### 1. Data Loading üóÉÔ∏è
- Loaded the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), split into training and testing sets.

### 2. Data Preprocessing üßπ
- Normalized the pixel values of the images to a range of [0, 1] to improve model performance.
- Reshaped the images from 28x28 pixels into the format required by the CNN (adding a channel dimension for grayscale).

### 3. Model Development ü§ñ
- Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture, which includes:
  - Convolutional layers to extract features.
  - Max pooling layers to down-sample the feature maps.
  - Dense layers for final classification.

### 4. Training the Model üèãÔ∏è
- Trained the model using the training set, incorporating a validation set to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
- Utilized techniques such as dropout for regularization during training.

### 5. Model Evaluation üìä
- Evaluated the model on the test set to determine accuracy.
- Visualized performance metrics such as accuracy and loss using plots to understand the model's learning behavior.

### 6. Prediction & Testing üîç
- Predicted handwritten digits from new images and visualized test images alongside predictions to assess model performance.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of over 99% on the test dataset.
